# Circadian_Genes_Benchmark

This repository contains the assessment of seven different methods used to identify circadian transcriptomes. We not only provide our assessment results, but also an example of method executions. 

## Introduction 

Circadian rhythm is an approximately 24 hour oscillaiton that In the past decades, many algorithms have been developed to detect circadian transcriptomes.
