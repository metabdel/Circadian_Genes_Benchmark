# Circadian_Genes_Benchmark

This repository contains the assessment of Seven different methods used to identify circadian transcriptomes. We provide not only our assessment results, but also an example of method executions. 

## Introduction 

Many methods have been developed to identify circadian gene. 

## Vignette 

Please consult our [vignette](https://github.com/wenwenm183/Circadian_Genes_Benchmark/blob/master/vignettes/Vignettes-of-Circadian-Paper.htmlm) for guidance on how to execute different methodologies.
