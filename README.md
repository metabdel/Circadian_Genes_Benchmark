# Circadian_Genes_Benchmark

This repository contains the assessment of seven different methods used to identify circadian transcriptomes. We not only provide our assessment results, but also an example of method executions. 

## Introduction 

Circadian rhythm is an approximately 24 hour oscillation of biological processes that exists in organisms, including humans. Over the last two decades, various algorithms have been developed to detect these circadian rhythm. Here, we present our analysis and user-guideline of seven algorthims, including Lomb Scargle, ARSER, JTK_CYCLE, RAIN, eJTK_CYCLE, MetaCycle, and BIO_CYCLE. 

## Vignette 

Please consult our [vignette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wenwenm183/Circadian_Genes_Benchmark/master/vignettes/Vignettes-of-Circadian-Paper.html) for guidance on how to execute different methodologies.
